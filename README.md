Coding Bootcamp HW4 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**Crystal Collector** is a number strategy game in which 
the user attempts match a goal by collecting points from crystals. The goal is set by the computer and the crystal values are unknown to the user until they are selected during the game.

This game is useful to learn the principals of javascript *objects*. This game is coded as an object.
